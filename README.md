# Uplay DLL Loaders

Uplay is using dlls to send the same arguments to the "core" dlls.\
That type of dlls are bigger and communicating via Protobuf on Namedpipe.\
My goal is using the same kind of "loaders" in this project.

# Uplay/UPC R2
Currently this is the most used and recent one.
I think if they not updating it, will stay and not need any update.

# Uplay/UPC R1
The upc_r1 version used just a few time before they updated to r2.
Uplay_R1 is the long lived used ones.

# Orbit
The ancient one.
