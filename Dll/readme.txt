The path.txt use to communicate to all uplay style dll file in ClientApp
Place your path to the txt
Example:
G:\CustomUplay\Client

The dll must in that directory, if you dont place the path.txt It automaticly try to use path next to the file (Currently no exit if fail)

main.crt file to know the file was signed by me.
(If you add this as Root CA you can sure all app are signed & tested by me | NOT NEEDED)
